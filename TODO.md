# Quiz Host Page Design Updates

## Issues to Fix:

1. ✅ Change host page design to glassy style like settings page
2. ✅ Remove excessive colors - only choices should have background colors
3. ✅ First choice should be green, second red, third blue, fourth yellow (corrected order)
4. ✅ Remove direct responses - show choice statistics first, then current ranking
5. ✅ Make ranking take full screen when shown

## Implementation Plan:

- [x] Update host page background to gray-50 with glassy elements
- [x] Remove colorful backgrounds from header and stats
- [x] Apply specific colors to choices: green, red, blue, yellow
- [x] Change response display to show choice statistics instead of direct responses
- [x] Make leaderboard display full screen when active
- [x] Update spacing and padding for better glassy design
